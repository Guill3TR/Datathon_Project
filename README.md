The Datathon consists of a real complete project 🚀, starting with the loading of data into a database 📊, and continuing with SQL queries 💾, a predictive time series model ⏰, the management of the machine learning model in an efficient and effective way using MLOPS 🛠️, and finally, visualising the results in Power BI 📈.
